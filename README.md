# 500HatsForRefugees – Independent Team Project

**Location:** Evanston, Illinois  
**Context:** Northwestern University – Problem-Based Learning (PBL) class project on Agile development  

This project involved partnering with a real-world client to design and implement a **full-stack web application** addressing operational challenges for 500HatsForRefugees, a nonprofit organization. Our goal was to streamline donation tracking and distribution while applying Agile methodologies in a team setting.

## Project Overview

- **Client Engagement:**  
  We actively sought out our client for the PBL class project. Worked closely with non-technical stakeholders to understand their workflow, gather requirements, and translate operational needs into testable system specifications.

- **Agile Development:**  
  Adopted an Agile SDLC with iterative development, sprint planning, and regular feedback sessions with the client to refine features and resolve workflow inefficiencies.

- **Full-Stack Implementation:**  
  Built and deployed an **end-to-end web application** using:  
  - **React** – Front-end interface for users and staff  
  - **Node.js** – Backend API and server logic  
  - **Firebase** – Authentication, database, and hosting

## Key Features

- **Donation Impact Carousel**  
  Donors can upload a picture of the hat they donated along with a message. All submissions are displayed in an interactive carousel, allowing users to see the tangible impact of their contributions.  

- **Upcoming Events for Recipients**  
  Refugees and community members can view upcoming events to receive hats, including key details like date, time, and location.  

- **Volunteer Opportunities**  
  Potential volunteers can browse and sign up for events. A map view allows filtering by zip code, radius, and event type, making it easy to find opportunities nearby.  

- **Volunteer & Event Management (Admin Portal)**  
  Admins can indicate the number of volunteers needed per event, track volunteer sign-ups, and manage both events and volunteers from the portal.  

- **Volunteer Portal**  
  Volunteers have their own interface to see upcoming events, sign up, and view details about their commitments.

## User Testing Insights

We conducted user testing with admins, volunteers, and partner organizations to evaluate usability:  

**Admin Workflow:**  
- Manage donation event requests, moderate images, track donations  
- Manage volunteers and events, including indicating needed volunteer counts  
- Feedback suggested clarifying withdrawal actions, adding comment fields, and showing donation acknowledgements  

**Volunteer Experience:**  
- Volunteers can browse and sign up for events  
- Map-based filtering and event details were highlighted as important for clarity  

**Information Availability:**  
- Users requested additional details: number of people served, community demographics, request logistics, and Amazon wishlist links  

**Interface & Layout:**  
- Suggested improvements: clickable images for details, “Our Story” tab with media coverage, display of items received to date, and a cohesive color scheme  

**Next Steps:**  
- Enhance admin interface clarity and volunteer tracking features  
- Improve volunteer portal experience with map filtering and event visibility  
- Incorporate storytelling elements and donation impact visuals
